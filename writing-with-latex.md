## writing with latex
### what is latex
LaTeX is a programming language that translates code (plain text, as usually) into pretty documents.

You use a text editor of your choice (Notepad, SublimeText, Atom etc.) to write the code, then you _compile_ it to produce the document. Note the difference between a _text editor_ (e.g. Notepad) and a _development environment_ (e.g. Texmaker or TeXworks). The latter is a convenient program to work with a programming language, harboring tools to compile and run code. The usual tradeoff between flexibility and extensibility on the one hand and operational simplicity on the other applies.
