## basics
In brief, a version control system is a software that allows you to take a snapshot of your project and revert to it if necessary &mdash; just like the backup feature on an operating system or a check point in a game.

There are several version control systems around: Git, Subversion etc. &mdash; and we will be using Git here. As stated on the [webpage](https://git-scm.com/):
> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system...

The following is based on \[[atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)\] and \[[git-book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)\].

## installation
Follow the instructions on the webpage to install git. We will be mostly using the built-in git support in Atom/PyCharm/RStudio, but also take a look at the command line way to better understand what is going on under the hood.

> \[[git-book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)\] The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.

## starting to version control
You can put a directory under version control &mdash; and the project directory is an obvious choice! Go to your project directory and execute
```
git init
```
Now the directory is a local (existing on your machine rather than somewhere else) *repository* (virtual storage space). If you want to share your project (or just make it accessible from everywhere), you would have to find a *remote* place to store your repository. Places like [https://www.atlassian.com/](atlassian.com) and [https://github.com/](github.com) serve this purpose. Once you have an account, you can create a remote repository there and point your local repository to it.
```
git remote add <shortname> <url>
```

You can check the status of the repo anytime:
```
git status
```
Check the status after each of the following subsections!

## tracking changes
Create a file, e.g. `todo.txt` within the folder. Make it tracked (known to git):
```
git add todo.txt
```
Now you have taken a snapshot of the file and made it *staged*. You can continue to work on the file or commit the snapshot.
> \[[git-book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)\] If you modify a file after you run `git add`, you have to run `git add` again to stage the latest version of the file.

To commit means to persist changes in the repository. The repo can then be reverted back to any committed version. You can think of this similar to the multiverse theory: with each commit, the universe of your project branches, so that if you are unhappy with a branch you are perching on, you can go back to where the branch originated and take a parallel branch. Do not ignore the commit message &mdash; these make it easier to navigate in the change history!
```
git commit -m "initial commit of todo"
```
You can look up the history of commits:
```
git log --oneline
```
## publishing changes
Having committed stuff, it is time to *push* it to the remote repo thus making the changes public. Anyone with access to the remote repo will be able to integrate the changes into their own working copy.
```
git push
```

## fixing the screwed-up
The following describes three cases which I have encountered the most. All other cases are left for you to explore on demand.

### 1. roll back changes in a file
Reason: one file is doomed, let me discard all changes, committed or not, staged or not, and just make the file match a previous commit:
```
git checkout <SHA> <filename>
```

### 2. roll back changes in repo
Reason: everything since a previous commit is ugly and I do not want to see it anymore.

You can undo changes that havenâ€™t been shared with anyone else using
```
git reset <SHA> --hard
```
Make sure you **really** mean it though, as your repo will be updated to match the specified commit and all staged and unstaged changes will be lost.

### 3. roll back changes via a new commit
Reason: A previous commit was faulty, and I want to undo those changes, but keep the shameful history.

You can undo all changes in a commit using:
```
git revert <SHA>
```
This is kind of applying the inverse of a commit from your project history. Let the `<SHA>` of the commit you do not like be `sha_1`. If you run `git revert <sha_1>`, a new commit is made with a new `<SHA>`, let it read `<sha_2>`. Now, if you run `git revert <sha_2>`, the repo is back to where you started before running the first revert.

Unlike `git reset`, this command adds a new commit that restores the tree to some previous state instead of clipping the tree. This is both safer and easier to work with, especially if you previously pushed your commit and others cloned it. In general, **never use `git reset` when changes have been pushed to a public repository and other people rely on them**.

## ignoring files
Some files and folders do not need to be tracked, for instance, temporary files, large data containers (a .csv file with stock price history), auxiliary files such as LaTeX's .aux and .fft, project-specific software settings etc. To exclude those, you create file called `.gitignore` in your repo and fill it with relative or absolute paths to files and folder that you want to exclude from version control. Some examples:

path | purpose
--- | ---
`data/`  |  folder **data/**
`data/*` <br> `!data/description.txt` | everything in folder **data/** except file **description.txt**
`*.log` | files with extension '**.log**'

Note however that
> git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.

To stop the file from being tracked, see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274057/how-to-make-git-forget-about-a-file-that-was-tracked-but-is-now-in-gitignore).

## exercises
1.  Having made a major super important commit after a whole day of work, you realize that you forgot to delete one comma in a file. Instead of making another commit too minor to be deem important and in order to keep things tidy &mdash; how would you amend the previous commit?
2.  What about importing a remote repository into your local project space?
3.  How to revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit?
