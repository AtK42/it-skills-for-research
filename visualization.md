## primary vs secondary information
Let's say you are presenting your research findings which are that Tesla has outperformed the S\&P500 index in terms of the stock price appreciation, as supported by this image:

... or is it really? As the brain of an audience member starts to make sense out of the slide, it (the brain) has to process the following:
*   the concept of a chart;
*   the concept of an index;
*   spacial representation of time flow;
*   colormap;
*   representation of dates;
*   ...
*   \[a million other things\]
*   ...
*   the fact that Tesla has outperformed S\&P500.

One immediate problem with the chart above is the unusual spacial representation of time: therein it flows right-to-left instead of left-to-right as the overwhelming majority of us are accustomed to. This custom is by no means instinct in all humans, but rather internalized in the first years of our life in a culture-specific way: indeed, certain peoples such as Aymara, when asked to point in the direction of time flow, would place past events to the left of future ones.

Although rather artificial, the example highlights several things to keep in mind when visualizing research findings:
*   there is what can heuristically be called **primary** and **secondary** information on every slide;
*   the brain needs to process both;
*   brain resources are limited;
*   there are certain pre-wired structures the brain uses to economize.

It is the presenter's task to understand these concepts and be informed of the wiring of the audience's brains to foster concentration on the primary information. Which would maybe imply drawing charts differently for Aymara speakers.
