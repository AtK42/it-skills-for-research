technical skills for academic (not only) research, may be a bit finance-centric

# prerequisites
*   intermediate knowledge of python or R: how to write a function, plot a chart, format string values, read to and write from text files etc.;
*   previous exposure to research projects;
*   an account on Slack: all communication takes place there.

# midterm
the midterm is there to make sure all the work is not being postponed until it is too late. please have the end-of-chapter exercises (the ones before the midterm) solved by **date tba** and pushed to branch 'midterm'.

# assignment
the final assignment should be completed in groups of 2-3 people by mid December (precise date to be announced shortly) in form of a project; here are the requirements
1. make it hosted as a single repository on Github 
2. make group mambers contributors and avoid ghost commits;
2. structure it neatly and concisely, avoid the clutter of folders and files for which third people have no use (use .gitignore!);
3. keep working on it consistently, avoid bulk commits
4. boasting a database with an API and possibility to update data;
5. featuring a paper (does not have to be of meaningful content) written in LaTeX, with sections, a table of contents, tables and figures;
6. featuring a beamer presentation (does not have to be of meaningful content though) written in LaTeX, with sections, a table of contents, tables and figures...
7. ...where figures adhere to the visualization standards discussed in the corresponding lectures;
8. with one interactive app (R shiny or jupyter notebook) presenting some findings (or some meaningless data, e.g. the histogram of Laplace distribution).
