technical skills for academic (not only) research, may be a bit finance-centric

# midterm
the midterm is there to make sure all the work is not being postponed until it is too late. please have the end-of-chapter exercises (the ones before the midterm) solved by then: a way for us to check this is to look at the commit history of your repository.

# assignment
the final assignment should be completed in groups of 2-4 people by mid December (precise date to be announced shortly) in form of a project:
1. hosted as a single repository on Github;
2. having a well defined and concise structure;
3. having a history of commits and merges;
4. boasting a database with an API and possibility to update data;
5. featuring a paper (does not have to be of meaningful content) written in LaTeX, with sections, a table of contents, tables and figures;
6. featuring a beamer presentation (does not have to be of meaningful content though) written in LaTeX, with sections, a table of contents, tables and figures...
7. ...where figures adhere to the visualization standards discussed in the corresponding lectures;
8. (optional) with one interactive app or jupyter Notebook presenting some findings (or some meaningless data, e.g. the histogram of Laplace distribution).
