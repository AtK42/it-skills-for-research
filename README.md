technical skills for academic (not only) research, may be a bit finance-centric

# prerequisites
*   intermediate knowledge of python or R: how to write a function, plot a chart, format string values, read to and write from text files etc.;
*   previous exposure to research projects;
*   an account on Slack: all communication takes place there.

# workflow
please work in groups of 2-4 people and set up one (1) repository per group &ndash; this will be the place to keep your midterm and final assignments; groups must be formed before the 5th lecture starts (**date in 2022 tba**), the only allowed change after this deadline being leaving one.

# midterm
the midterm is there to make sure all the work is not being postponed until it is too late. please have the end-of-chapter exercises (the ones before the midterm) solved by **date tba** and pushed to branch 'midterm'.

# assignment
the final assignment should be completed in groups of 2-3 people by mid December (precise date to be announced shortly) in form of a project; here are the requirements:
1. make it hosted as a single repository on Github with all group members being contributors;
2. structure it neatly and concisely, avoid the clutter of folders and files for which third people have no use (use .gitignore);
3. keep working on it consistently, avoid bulk commits;
4. create a little well-documented database with the data you use, featuring possibility to update it with fresh values;
5. write a short paper using LaTeX, with sections, a table of contents, tables and figures that you create with the data above;
6. write a beamer presentation for your project using LaTeX;
7. keep figures and tables in line with the visualization standards discussed in class;
8. create one interactive app (R shiny or jupyter notebook) describing the main finding and presenting several robustness checks.
