### What are jupyter notebooks?

* The Jupyter Notebook is an app that runs within a web browser and allows us to create and share interactive documents that contain code, visualizations, equations and explanatory text.

* Jupyter has evolved from IPython and now accommodates many different programming languages: R, Julia, C++, etc.


* Jupyter is open source


### Why jupyter?

* The notebooks are easy to share and are a perfect medium to communicate the exact step-by-step process leading to the results of a research project. Hence it is important for reproducibility.


* The notebooks are interactive and hence provide a high didactic value allowing the target audience to better grasp the core concepts of research given hands-on examples


### Installation

* To run jupyter notebooks you need a Python installation. The recommended way is to install Anaconda distribution which comes with pre-packaged jupyter along with a suite of tools for data science


* For other configurations check [the official documentation](https://jupyter.org/install)


### Starting a new notebook

* To start a notebook open the command prompt, then navigate to the directory you will be working in and type in `jupyter notebook`.


* The command will start a notebook server which should be running while you are working in the notebook. For additional information like running the server using a custom IP or port, refer to [this page](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).


* The notebook will run in your browser. The first thing you see will be a dashboard where you can navigate in different directories and create new notebooks.
